## DEPENDENCIES

* The main requirements are:
    * [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html) for running unit tests
    * [pytest-cov](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov) for checking code coverage
    * Access to a Gitlab instance
    * Access to a build/test/server PC for `gitlab-runner`
* For other example-specific dependencies, see [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt).

## SETUP

* Configure app installation in [setup.py](./setup.py)
* Configure test configuration in [pytest.ini](./pytest.ini)
* Setup the Local Test Environment
    * Using **virtualenv**
        * Activate a virtual Environment
        * Install dependencies
            ```
            pip3 install -r requirements.txt

            ```
        * Install app in [editable mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs)
            ```
            pip3 install -e .

            ```
    * Using **Docker**
        * Create a Docker image from the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile)
            ```
            docker build --tag:sample-ci-python .
            docker run -it sample-ci-python:latest /bin/bash

            ```
* Setup Gitlab CI
    * [Install a Gitlab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/) on a publicly-accessible machine
    * [Register the Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/index.html) with your Gitlab instance
        * Get the coordinator URL and registration tokens:
            * For shared runners: <http://your/gitlab/instance/admin/runners>
            * For project-specific runners: <http://your/gitlab/project/settings/ci_cd>
        * Use [Docker as the executor](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html) (see [ISSUES](#issues) section on possible disk space issue)
        * Set project-specific [tags](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/#using-tags)
    * Configure the CI configuration in [.gitlab-ci.yml](./gitlab-ci.yml)
        * Set which Docker [image](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html#the-image-keyword) and [services](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html#the-services-keyword) to use
        * Set the [tags](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/#using-tags)
        * Set the commands for `before_script` and `script`
        * For other configurations, see [GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Configuration Reference](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/)
    * Configure the Gitlab Runner at *Gitlab project* > *Settings* > *CI/CD*
        * Select *Disable AutoDevOps* to explicitly require *.gitlab-ci.yml*
        * Enable the runner only for "important" commits
            * Enable only on tagged jobs
            * Enable only on protected branches (ex. `develop`, `master`)
        * Set other options such as *Timeout*, *Custom CI config path*, and *Triggers*
        * Sample Configuration:
            ![Sample Configuration](./docs/sample-ci-runner.png)

## USAGE

* Run the Tests on Local
    * From the **virtual environment** or from the **Docker image**
        ```
        pytest tests

        ...
        tests/provider_tests/...test_generate_integers_length PASSED            [1/3]
        tests/provider_tests/...test_generate_integers_start_and_stop PASSED    [2/3]
        tests/provider_tests/...test_generate_integers_step PASSED              [3/3]
        ...
        ```
* Run the Tests on Gitlab
    * Make changes in *src/app/* and in *tests/*
    * Make changes to the [.gitlab-ci.yml](./gitlab-ci.yml) configuration (if necessary)
    * Commit the changes then push to Gitlab
    * Go to the *Gitlab project* > *CI/CD* > *Pipelines*
    * Select the currently *running* job to view progress/result
    * It is possible to download the job log by clicking on the *Raw* button

## ISSUES

* `pytest` uses cached codes instead of latest
    * Clear the `pytest` cache with [--cache-clear](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/cache.html#clearing-cache-content)
    * Optionally, also [clear the generated *\_\_pycache\_\_*](https://stackoverflow.com/q/28991015/2745495)
* "*This job is stuck, because you donâ€™t have any active runners that can run this job.*"
    * Make sure that the *.gitlab-ci.yml* has the correct tags
    * Make sure the `gitlab-runner` service is running
    * Make sure the machine running `gitlab-runner` is accessible by the Gitlab instance
* "*yaml invalid*"
    * Go to the *Gitlab project* > *CI/CD*
    * On the top-right portion, click the *CI Lint* button
    * Paste the contents of *gitlab-ci.yml* file and validate
* The jobs are not running on the same runner/environment
    * Example: 1 job for build, 1 job for tests
    * As of now, Gitlab CI does not support this:
        * [Sticky Runners](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/29447)
        * [Caching general build artifacts between stages](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/336)
        * [Force all pipeline jobs to execute on same concurrent runner](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/30060)
    * The current workaround now is to use `before_script` to build and a job for tests
* The `gitlab-runner` is leaving a lot of `-cache-` containers/volumes
    * See a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/2980#note_106845694) of this behavior here
    * Possible solutions:
        * Manually regularly run `docker system prune`
        * Setup a `cron` job `docker system prune -f`
            ```
            # Cleanup docker containers/volumes every 3am every monday
            0 3 * * 1 /usr/bin/docker system prune -f

            ```
